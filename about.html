    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p style="color: blueviolet;">
    My name is <strong>Myah Dionisio</strong> and I am a high school teacher at The Hills Grammar School. I am currently still studying at Australian Catholic University as a fourth year student.</p>

        <h3>Teaching Areas</h3>
        <p style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">These are my teaching areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Design and Technologies</li>
            <li>Textiles</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: blue;">I have a very deep interest in fashion and have studied Bachelor of Fashion Design after high school. With the skills learnt from previous studies, I have been able to integrate them into my teaching practice as a D&T/TAS teacher. I am still developing my skills in other areas of D&T, including metalwork and timber.</p>
