<p>My teaching philosophy is shaped by my background in fashion design and my journey into education. Creativity has always been at the centre of my practice, and I see teaching as a way to share this passion while empowering students to develop their own voices as designers and problem-solvers.</p>
<p>I aim to be the kind of educator who uplifts, challenges and nurtures student creativity in meaningful ways. As a Design and Technologies teacher, I apply Universal Design for Learning to create inclusive classrooms where all students can access the curriculum in ways that suit their strengths. Specifically, I offer students choice in how they demonstrate understanding - whether through sketches, prototypes or written reflections. My approach is also informed by constructivist principles, where students build knowledge through inquiry, hands-on projects and iterative design thinking. I use project-based learning to mirror real-world design processes, encouraging learners to take ownership of their work and learn from re-learning. Through this, I strive to cultivate adaptive thinkers who can connect their ideas to authentic contexts. Across my exerience in both primary and secondary education, I have learned that flexibility and strong relationships are key to meaningful learning.</p>
